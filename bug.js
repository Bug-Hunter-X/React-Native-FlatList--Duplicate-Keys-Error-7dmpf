This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render items with a key that is not unique.  The key prop is crucial for efficient rendering and re-renders.  If keys are duplicated, FlatList will behave unpredictably, often leading to incorrect rendering or crashes.  Consider the following example: 

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{id: 1, name: 'Item 1'}, {id: 2, name: 'Item 2'}, {id: 1, name: 'Item 3'}]}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Duplicate key '1'
/>
```

In this scenario, `id:1` is repeated, causing the error. The `keyExtractor` function isn't correctly providing unique keys.
